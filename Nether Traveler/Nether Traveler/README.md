# Nether Traveler

This is one of my first solo projects, I was curious and I wanted to get coordinates to build nether portal links easily. So I made this small program to do the calculations for me.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository using HTTPS link
2. Open project in your preffered IDE
3. Run the Java project
   1. Running the Project looks different depending on your IDE but most I have seen have Run/Debug buttons that will automatically find the main function and run the program.

## Output

Once you run the program the results are similar to this
Example: `XYZ (-X=West)(X=East) 4.25 / 2.625 / 5.625 (-Z=North)(Z=South)`
in this case you would need to travel **in the Nether from the known portals location:**

- 4 blocks east
- 5 blocks South

We can usually ignore the Y value, you can really get away with being on any Y value as long as the X and Z values are correct.
